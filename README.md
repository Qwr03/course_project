# Course project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.4.

## Development server (Front-end part)

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. Just in case you don't know, u will need to install node modules first after downloading this repo (command: `npm i` from src folder), and the command to run all this should be executed from src/app - `ng serve --open`)

## Development server (Back-end part)

Run `flask run` for a dev server. It's running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. This will be needed for api working. Before u run the command from the folder `back` find the file `commands.txt` (U will find further instractions regarding back-end server there). Meanwhile find `requirements.txt`, u will need install all that and flask and much more. Good luck with that..
